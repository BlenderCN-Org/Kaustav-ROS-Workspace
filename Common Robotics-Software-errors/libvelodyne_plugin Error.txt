Error [Plugin.hh:180] libvelodyne_plugin.so: No such file or directory Gazebo 8.1.1


I am following this tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=gu...

When I run Gazebo:

gazebo --verbose ../velodyne.world
This error appears:

[Err] [Plugin.hh:180] Failed to load plugin libvelodyne_plugin.so: libvelodyne_plugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
How can I fix this?



################################

What is happening is that Gazebo can't find libvelodyne_plugin.so, this look for libraries in the directories indicate by LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviromental variable, so you need to indicate where to find it changing it.


export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:~/velodyne_plugin/build
